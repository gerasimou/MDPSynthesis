 // Number of excavation locations
 // Number of dump locations

// Parameters
const curLoc=0; // Current location of arm when planner is called (here we have a hardcoded value, but this will be provided to the planner)

// Special Locations
const locOrig=0;
const locNull=6+100; // Only auxiliary constants to define the range of variable loc

// Excavation Locations
const xloc1=1;
const xloc2=2;
const xloc3=3;

// Dump Locations
const dloc1=3;
const dloc2=4;
const dloc3=5;
const dloc4=6;


// Possible states of the mission (to keep track of progress)
const START=0;
const DONE_EXCAVATING=1;
const DONE_DUMPING=2;

// Module that is in charge of selecting an excavation location
// It tries one location first, and if it does not succeed, it goes to the next one.
// If all locations have been tried and state is still START (unsuccessful excavation), it fails

	// Excavation behavior
	// In the following commands, we have:
	// Command 1:
	// * A guard that checks: (1) that we are at the START of the mission
	// 			  (2) that we have not tried to excavate location A
	//			  (3) that the maximum number of excavation attempts has not been reached
	// * An update with probability ex_locA (excavatability of excavation location A) that:
	//			  (1) updates the variable saying that we have tried location A (not needed but left for clarity)
	// 			  (2) updates the variable that keeps track of excavation attempts
	//			  (3) updates the arm location variable to location A
	//            (4) updates the variable for excavation success in the current location to true	
	// * Another update with probability 1-ex_locA that:
	//			  (1) updates the variable saying that we have tried location A
	//			  (2) updates the arm location variable to location A (even if we have not succeeded excavating)
	// 			  (3) updates the variable that keeps track of excavation attempts
	// Command 2:
	// * A guard that checks: (1) that there is success in the current excavation location
	// * An update that: (1) sets the excavation success back to false
   	//			         (2) updates the state to successful excavation (DONE_EXCAVATING)
